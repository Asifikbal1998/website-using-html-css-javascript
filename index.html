                <h1>Tranforming Education in India</h1>
                <p>Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge
                    or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                    rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in
                    order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in
                    an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a
                    slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this
                    process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                    the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                    increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern
                    society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

                <h1>Types of Education</h1>
                <p>Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal
                    education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular
                    aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal
                    education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as
                    kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
                    alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but
                    in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil
                    society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any
                    experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,</p>

                <h1>Quality Education</h1>
                <p>In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal
                    learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as
                    nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.

                    Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                    directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a
                    variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

                    There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                    towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at
                    large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by
                    some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable
                    Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>
